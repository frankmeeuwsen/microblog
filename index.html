			 <p>Today&rsquo;s plan was to visit <a href="https://helldorado.nl/">Helldorado Festival</a> in Eindhoven. A full day of loud music and good food. Due to the lingering back pain though, it is not wise to be around thousands of head banging, moshpitting and shoulder-slapping rockers. Too bad, I really looked forward to seeing Life of Agony, Peter Pan Speedrock, Prong, Speedmobile and many, many others. I got to sell my tickets, so there&rsquo;s a silver lining. To get an idea of the festival, check their Instagram page with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CzbXN3vPIEM/">an after movie</a> of last year&rsquo;s edition.</p>

			 <p>After a few days on micro.blog it occurred to me, I don&rsquo;t have a clue who follows me. Or when someone starts following me. I know who I follow, around 136 people, most of them from micro.blog. A few from the wider Fediverse.
To be honest, I don&rsquo;t know what to think of this. I am so used from other silo&rsquo;ed and algorithmically driven networks to seeing who follows me, if they are interesting to me to follow back. Not even the follower/following ratio, I couldn&rsquo;t care about that. But just exploring and discovering fascinating stories in my followers-list. It&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s missing here deliberately, and I need to get used to that.</p>
<p>Does that make sense? Does it feel familiar?</p>

I want to re-read the stories, especially the ones I read back in April/May. Those stories have faded somewhat from my memory and I want to retrieve them for a proper review on my blog and personal memory. I have not been so impressed with someone&rsquo;s penmanship in a long time. After reading Exhalation and this book, I am eager to find more comparable stories and authors!</p>

			 <p>Blogrolls are the best artifacts of the Early World Wide Web. Or Weird Wide Web if you like. As you would look at someone&rsquo;s collection of books or vinyl, the same goes for blogrolls.

Knowing that the author of the list is someone you can trust.

			 <p>From a blog meme to a new theme, my first 24 hours on micro.blog were very pleasant. It&rsquo;s a quiet part of the Internet in a very good way. Much of the Web has turned into a non-stop Saturday afternoon in the center of a medium-sized city. Where you stumble across bargain hunters, protesters, screaming bachelor parties and obscure market vendors.</p>
<p>Oh my goodness. I have become the old man yelling at the cloud!</p>

<p>I am more at ease in this suburb. Not too well known but just enough to attract interesting neighbourhood people. With stories of their own, without ego, with a balance of listening, talking, asking and giving advice.
Meanwhile, it is my umpteenth home on the web in the past 25 years. For 10 years I&rsquo;ve been active on <a href="https://diggingthedigital.com">Digging the Digital</a>, built on WordPress, after a brief courtship with static site generator Jekyll. That site is in need of rebuilding. It squeaks and creaks because of all the little jobs I&rsquo;ve done myself. I am not a contractor and have two left hands. I can hang a shelf just fine if someone shows me, but don&rsquo;t make me put in a new dormer or completely renovate an existing room. That&rsquo;s asking for future problems. Unlike being a homeowner in <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Real_life">meatspace</a>, online you can easily move your presence from a to b if you need to. Micro.blog has been around since 2017 and has proven itself to be a well-versed web service. How might I step into this new neighbourhood? Some thoughts&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="fediverse">Fediverse</h2>
<p>Since Elon Musk&rsquo;s takeover of Twitter and his weekly delusions of how to make this global village square work better, I left. I&rsquo;ve been inactive since December 2022 and deleted my account in August 2023. I made the move to Mastodon. I am more than happy with <a href="https://indieweb.social/about">indieweb.social</a> which is my home on the Fediverse (<a href="https://jointhefediverse.net/">What is the Fediverse?</a>).
In email exchanges with my friend <a href="https://ovr.micro.blog/">Oskar van Rijswijk</a> we regularly talk about simplifying. With micro.blog I can just as easily connect to the Fediverse. That does mean I have to move the network I built up over the past 12 months (again?). The steps are <a href="https://help.micro.blog/t/mastodon-and-activitypub/95">well described</a> on micro.blog and it has the added advantage that I can build a Fediverse account on my own domain.</p>
<p>I wrote about Digital Domestic Cozy (<a href="https://diggingthedigital-com.translate.goog/digital-domestic-cozy-op-het-web/?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=nl&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp">translated version</a>) on my Dutch-language blog before, the small(er) networks like micro.blog and <a href="https://omg.lol/">omg.lol</a>. I have a paid account on both because I love this online undercurrent. As well as the community on indieweb.social. Yet therein lies the crux now. The community.</p>
<h2 id="community">Community</h2>
<p>I chose my Fediverse account on indieweb.social initially because of the name. Plus the thought of finding a community of like-minded people. There is a community. I just have very little interaction with it. I sometimes follow <a href="https://indieweb.social/public/local">the local timeline</a> and that&rsquo;s about it. On omg.lol I started without any prior idea. I just love their service and style. They build a fantastic collection of separate services that connect through visual style and clever domain names. But I have a hard time finding the community, despite access to forum, Mastodon and even <a href="https://home.omg.lol/info/irc">IRC</a>.
At micro.blog, the community is more palpable. I run into some old acquaintances, I found a group of like-minded people just like on indieweb.social. The barrier to interaction is a bit lower because it <em>feels</em> like it&rsquo;s more segregated from the larger Fediverse. So you feel more at ease to connect and interact. Micro.blog is built as its own service, while you can easily connect to the outside world through existing protocols. But when I add my network, I follow 750 accounts on Mastodon, I instantly turn my own timeline into a noisy neighborhood party. Do I really want that?
On top of that, some 2,000 accounts that follow me on indieweb.social will receive a move notification. Would that go well? Often it does, I think. But I can&rsquo;t use micro.blog (<a href="https://help.micro.blog/t/following-hashtags-feature-request/1426/4">yet!</a>)to follow hashtags across the Fediverse as easily as I do in Mastodon. I might have to change that to <a href="https://diggingthedigital-com.translate.goog/rss-feeds-in-mastodon/?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=nl&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp">following the RSS-feeds of those hashtags</a> in the fediverse. I just love typing that previous sentence. It shows how open and <a href="https://www.smallpieces.com/">loosely joined</a> all those protocols are.</p>
<h2 id="migration-wordpress">Migration WordPress</h2>
<p>I can migrate my blog with over 20 years of blog posts from WordPress to micro.blog, to keep the entire archive together. In recent years, I have been referring more and more to older blog posts. Many ideas I have published or linked to before, so it is convenient to keep referring to them. If this is all in one place, I like that. Migration of my WordPress blog is an undertaking in itself. I use the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/indieweb-post-kinds/">Post Kinds</a> plugin for years with which I have published about 750 posts. Bookmarks, likes and short notes. The problem with that plugin is that of the saved bookmarks and likes, the URL is not in the WordPress post itself, but in a separate table (wp_postmeta). The default import for micro.blog does <em>not</em> include this information. On my WordPress blog I first have to make a conversionscript for this plugin to add everything from wp_postmeta to the default WordPress wp_posts table. This means I have to write separate code. Or have it written, see my earlier job-skills explanation. I do think it&rsquo;s worth doing that, the archive is very valuable to me after all these years. But it takes time and energy.</p>
<h2 id="mothership">Mothership</h2>
<p>Everyone needs an online mothership. A domain name and a privately owned space on the web. That&rsquo;s my firm belief. I&rsquo;ve been writing about it <a href="https://diggingthedigital-com.translate.goog/welkom-op-het-moederschip/?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=nl&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp">since 2010</a>. That&rsquo;s why I want a blog on my own domain. This is no problem on micro.blog. But what domain will I use? If I have trouble getting my current WordPress posts imported I may choose to turn diggingthedigital.com into an archive and continue on frankmeeuwsen.com. People who really (want to) follow me can make that switch just fine in their feedreader or bookmarks. The added benefit of the microblog service is that I can create a fediverse account on my own domain. That&rsquo;s how I think the Internet should be, everyone&rsquo;s own piece of land where you can do what you want. With your own address.</p>
<h2 id="continued">Continued</h2>
<p>Step one is to phase out the Post Kinds plugin on my current blog and merge the data from that plugin with the standard WordPress posts. Let&rsquo;s see if that works. After that, I can take the next steps: Create a static archive and host it on a good place, convert the domains and move my Mastodon account.</p>
<p>Really one of those jobs I can do in the intimacy of my own neighbourhood&hellip;.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780759523562">With the Light: Raising an Autistic Child (With the Light, #1)</a> by Keiko Tobe üìö</p>
<p>I read this first chapter of the extended manga series some time ago. The story still touches me, about a young family in modern Japan raising a child with autism. In a society where there is little support for autism. The mother does everything possible to give her son a good upbringing and education. There is much ignorance in her environment around autism. Slowly, she meets more like-minded people who accept her son as he is.</p>
<p>I once found the complete series in a Manga and Anime exhibition in our public library. You can see the size of each volume on the picture below. This exhibition was organized with a local Manga shop who, as I <a href="https://www.mangakissa.nl/nieuws/2022/10/19/locatie-pauwstraat-permanent-gesloten-per-1-november">just found out</a>, have gone out of business in 2022.</p>
<p>More about the series can be found on <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/With_the_Light">WikiWand</a></p>

			 <p>I truly worry more and more on the state of big networks like Facebook. Articles like <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/25/facebook-orwellian-journalists-democracy-guatemala-slovakia">this</a> in The Guardian  about the newsfeedtests if FB in countries are scary&hellip;</p>

			 <p>With one day left in my trial account for Micro.blog I need to figure out what my usecase would be for this. I already have my own Jekyll-based site on <a href="http://diggingthedigital.com/.">diggingthedigital.com/.</a> So another blog would be no use for me.
I like some of the other conversations going on here but do I need to pay to see and participate in it? That is not quite clear to me.
What would 5 dollar a month buy me that a free micro.blog account or my current blog doesn&rsquo;t have? Is there a free micro.blog account? What does it have and what does it lack?</p>
<p>I have no problem to support indie developers but I already have some Patreon backings going for other developers. Choices.
It all boils down to communicating what your service has to offer. Now it is unclear to me. The <a href="http://help.micro.blog/">Help-page</a> doesn&rsquo;t give a hint either.</p>
<p>I think I just wait and see what happens.</p>

			 <p>As Ice Cube would say, today was a good day. Started with a run in the park. Did some fun support &amp; community work for Triggi. Had a nice lunch with the missus. Made pizza with and for the kids.</p>

			 <p>I‚Äôm still figuring out how ‚Äúowning your own content‚Äù helps me to engage on other networks. The startingpoint of IndieWeb always seems to be me starting something. Which is not always the case. I respond, retweet, favorite, build upon. How does that work? #IndieQuestions</p>

			 <p>According to Jack, we <a href="https://jack.baty.net/2017/i-just-want-everyone-to-start-blogging-again/">should</a>. But meh&hellip; we had that hype 15 years ago. Too much hassle for a lot of people. They want to connect. They want a familiar place. Innovation and upgrades when they log in again.
I know about the Indieweb. I‚Äôve had my fair share of discussions on blogs vs social. But here‚Äôs the thing, times have changed. Mobile won. Facebook won. Instagram will win. For the coming decade. Something else comes along and that will win. Indie blogs will never win. And that‚Äôs a good thing.</p>
